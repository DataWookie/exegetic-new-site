#### Objectives

The objectives of a hackathon are:

- to relax and have fun together as a team;
- to get something tangible done; and
- to learn something new.

#### Projects

A hackathon can focus on a single project or have multiple projects running in parallel.

A hackathon can be the start of new projects or extend existing projects.

If there’s a new project then there are some special considerations:

- provide people with background information before the event;
- define tasks; and
- help people get started on the day and provide direction.
- Who’s responsible for setting these things up? The person who proposes the project?
- Should this person be solely responsible for planning the project or should the nascent “team” collaborate in the planning?

#### Logistics

1. Have well defined start and finish times. Finish time should not be too late in the day.
2. At the end of the hackathon plan to have a feedback session.

    - What were you working on?
    - How far did you get?
    - What did you learn?
    - What obstacles did you encounter?
    - Is there something you’d like further input or help with?

3. If the plan is to go out after the hackathon, share the plan with everybody. Venue and time should be planned in advance.

#### Frequency

A hackathon is a relatively expensive event, principally due to lost productivity. However, this needs to be weighed against the various benefits of the event.

These considerations influence how often we can hold a hackathon. Ideally we’d aim to have one every two to three months.
