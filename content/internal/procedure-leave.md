### Sick leave

3. You are expected to notify Exegetic of your absence timeously. You must continue to do so daily until you return to work.


### Pre-leave responsibilities

<!-- Once any leave has been granted you will need to inform your collegues by: -->
1. Add a public Out of Office message to the relevant dates on your Gmail calendar.
2. Add an Out of Office AutoReply to your Gmail and include:
 - your "First day" as well as your "Last day"
 - a subject line which details when your leave starts and ends
 - who a client should contact if there's something that needs urgent attention
3. Update your status on Slack to read "Off sick", "At a conference" or "Vacationing" and ensure the "clear after" is set correctly. 
4. Inform the colleague whom you've listed as your emergency work contact that they might receive additional emails in your absence.
5. Send a message in the "general" Slack channel informing your colleagues that you'll be away. Also, mention what would be the best form of communication in case something urgent comes up.
