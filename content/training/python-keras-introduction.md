intro: |
  Deep Learning is a vast and convoluted topic. It’s hard to know where to start. This workshop will help you take your first steps with Deep Learning.

  The workshop will introduce you to the fundamental concepts behind Deep Learning and show you how to get started building models using Python and Keras. You'll learn some of the underlying maths (a PhD in Mathematics will not be required!) and work through several examples.

  You’ll walk away with an appreciation for what’s possible with Deep Learning and sufficient hands-on experience to start building your own models.

  All material will be available as Jupyter Notebooks.
duration: 1 day
requirements: |
  Familiarity with programming in Python. A basic understanding of Machine Learning concepts will be helpful but certainly not essential.
