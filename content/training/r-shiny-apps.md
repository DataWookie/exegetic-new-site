title: "Shiny â€” Building Data-Driven Apps"

subjects: ['R']

intro: |
  The Shiny package makes it easy to create interactive web applications using R.
duration: 2 days
who: |
  The course is aimed at students, academics and professionals who want to build interactive web applications.
objectives: >
  An interactive web application is a great way to allow people to interact with data. The conventional approach to developing such an application requires knowledge of a range of web development tools. However, the Shiny package makes it possible to easily build a web application using only R. This allows you to focus on the data and user experience.
outcomes: |
  Participants will:

  - understand the structure of a Shiny application (UI and server);
  - be able to assemble an attractive UI;
  - understand reactivity and how the UI and server communicate with each other; and
  - know how to deploy a Shiny application.
requirements: |
  Participants are assumed to have prior exposure to R, or at least to programming of some variety. Ideally participants should have completed the [Data Wrangling]({{< ref "r-data-wrangling.md" >}}) and [Visualisation]({{< ref "r-visualisation.md" >}}) modules.
setup: |
  ```r
  install.packages(
    c("shiny", "rmarkdown", "DT", "devtools", "flexdashboard",
      "gapminder", "rticles", "shinydashboard", "shinythemes",
      "tidyverse", "tufte", "xaringan"),
    repos = "http://cran.rstudio.com"
  )
  ```
