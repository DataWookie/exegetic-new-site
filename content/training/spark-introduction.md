Apache Spark is a fast, general-purpose system for cluster computing on large datasets.

This course uses Python to interact with Spark.

The first part of the course is an introduction to working with Spark. It will enable you to

- load structured or unstructured data into Spark;
- understand the way that data are distributed across a Spark cluster;
- apply transformations and actions to the data.

In the second part of the course you'll learn how to build Machine Learning models on large datasets using Spark. You'll be able to

- create classification and regression models;
- use pipelines to streamline your workflow; and
- combine pipelines with cross-validation and grid-search to optimise model parameters.

All material will be available as Jupyter Notebooks.
