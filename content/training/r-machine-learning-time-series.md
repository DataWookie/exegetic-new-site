intro: |
  A Time Series model allows you to make predictions about the future based on observations from the past. These models have important applications in science, industry and commerce.

  > *Prediction is very difficult, especially if it's about the future.*<br>&mdash; Niels Bohr, Nobel Laureate (Physics)

  Niels Bohr was right: predicting the future is a tough problem. Some things, like lottery numbers, are inherently unpredictable. Others, like air temperatures and rainfall, are reasonably predictable. Time series analysis makes it possible to assess whether or not predictions are possible and, if they are, build a model which can generate informed predictions for the future with realistic estimates of uncertainty.

  > *The best qualification of a prophet is to have a good memory.*<br>&mdash; George Savile

  This course will provide you with an understanding of the theory behind time series models and the ability to build such models in R. By the end of the course you'll be able to select the appropriate model for your data, train a model and start making predictions.
duration: 2 days
why: |
  1. Understand tools and methods of forecasting.
  2. Select appropriate forecasting techniques.
  3. Predict trends and estimate uncertainty.
  4. Use forecasting to improve decision-making and strategic planning.
  5. Evaluate and iteratively improve forecast accuracy.

  Anybody interested in predicting the future will benefit from this course.

  - Analysts and strategic planners.
  - Managers (sales, marketing, product, business, financial, HR, inventory and supply chain).
  - Researchers.
